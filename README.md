## The process

I actually spent a couple days on designing the look of the application using Figma. [Here](https://www.figma.com/file/AyfpIzP3Ss7BplB5eABZ2O/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1) is a final look of the design before I started coding.

Before I even looked at the specifications on how to move forward with this project, I had an idea of having a card for the form elements and for the inputted values to just show up on the same card as soon the form had been submitted. 

#### Turned out okay

I definitely would have wrote way less JS code if I had just made a popup or something for the form, but I learned alot about dynamically creating elements. 

## What I learned 
- Writing object constructors 
- Prototypes

## Features to implement
- A way to store all the added cards even after user exits page
- Better and more specific validation for each input
- Reponsive design for mobile 
- Add stats
